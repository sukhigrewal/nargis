Welcome to nargis.

Thank you for visiting nargis blog, code name nargis, **a yoga blog maintained to increase practice knowledge.**

This work is created at this time by a single author, presented as a self-exploration paired with research into topics surrounding yoga, the mind, the body and more. Developing this work is important to me and it's a creative place to land for you and I both. Outside a dialogue where yoga and lifestyle are the main topics, I wanted to make a place to be who I am. I am sure nargis will quickly become a place to curate music, art, poetry, and film, at least what I know of it, as it pertains to nargis domains and traditions coming from India introduced to me by family (music) or exploration (art) and self-study (yoga).

Information integral to broader nargis domains (life, health, beauty, self-knowledge) is flawed. It's difficult to find and when found, it isn't all in one place, and it isn't contemporary, ethereal, or cultured. Sources are flawed, too. At times, information is not properly researched and cited. At times, it's appropriated. Next to none of it posesses the quality or sophistication I expect as a 29 year old American woman. It isn't actionable enough, then, to lend itself to the critical reader. In nargis, I want to offer a new look at the available discourse, adding to it from my own experience and making it easy to find, all in one place. It should benefit the modern person, and deliver original, applicable, healthy thinking and ideologies. I say the project is for me because editorializing is an act of self-care, one I haven't experienced without experiencing publishing. Moreover, reporting on the topics is very dear to me because much of what will be found here has been formative to my life and identity, and has saved me. I say it's for me, because when you make something and give it away, it's one of the best feelings in the world. I say it's for you because you're all I have.

My name is Sukhdeep Grewal and I am the creator of nargis.
