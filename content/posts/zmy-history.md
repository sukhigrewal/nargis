welcome to nargis.

This work is created at this time by a single author, a self-exploration paired with research into topics surrounding yoga, the mind, the body and more. Developing this body of work is important for numerous reasons but ultimately it is a project for me, and a project for you. 

I wanted to make nargis for a long time, to give away traditions which developed my nature for the better, gave me inner peace, and made me feel free from pain. 

Experiences in life are formative and I believe light must 

One of the aims of nargis is to enhance the knowledge of the western practitioner.

My name is Sukhdeep Grewal and I am the creator of nargis.

Thank you for visiting nargis blog, project code name nargis.
