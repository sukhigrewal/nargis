title: What is nargis?
author: Sukhi Grewal

Welcome to nargis.

Thank you for visiting nargis blog, code name nargis, **a self-care blog maintained to increase experience knowledge.**

This work is created by a single author. It's presented as a self-exploration paired with research into topics surrounding **yoga**, **the mind, the body and more: beauty, emotion, stress, psychology**. Outside a dialogue where living and lifestyle are the main topics, nargis is a place to come for art, music, poetry, and film. Something I knew I needed but didn't know which form it would take, **nargis is an homage to Indian culture** and traditions introduced to me by family (music), exploration (art) and study (yoga). These areas have been formative to my own practice and identity, and **nargis is meant to free me, making room to find new modes of being**, and new things out about myself, my body, my environment. I'm using nargis to take me where I want to go. This is what works for me but nargis is written for those who want to know what that is.

Other nargis domains are nutrition, health and self-knowledge. I want to include information in these domains for a number of reasons. Original content is difficult to find, isn't all in one place, and isn't **contemporary, ethereal, or cultured**. There is a problem of competing philosophies. If it's well-presented, it's not well-researched. If else, it's appropriated. Without quality, originality and sophistication, it isn't worth it **for the critical reader**. In nargis, I address this. I make what I expect, offer a new look at the available discourse, and add to it from my own experience. It should be easy to find, all in one place, and benefit the modern person. Most of all, it should be applicable and inspiring, enough for those who are reading it to keep coming back.

I say this project is made for me. **It's everything I couldn't find on the web, everything I was missing, and everything missing from yoga in the west as I've experienced it for fifteen years**. Editorializing is an act of self-care. This is my voice and nargis is my chance. Moreover, I _have to_ become a better person. Yoga, and my every act, is saving me. I say it's for me, because when you make something and give it away, it's one of the best feelings in the world. I say it's for you because you're all I have. **I'm not a perfect person and no one who does anything is.** You and I are both here because we want to be better.

My name is Sukhdeep Grewal and I am the creator of nargis.
