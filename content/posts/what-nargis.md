title: What is nargis?
author: Sukhi Grewal

Welcome to nargis.

Thank you for visiting nargis blog, code name nargis, **a yoga blog maintained to increase practice knowledge.**

This work is created by a single author. It's presented as a self-exploration paired with research into topics surrounding yoga, the mind, the body and more: beauty, emotion, stress, psychology. Outside a dialogue where living and lifestyle are the main topics, nargis is a place to come for art, music, poetry, and film. Something I knew I needed but didn't know which form it would be, nargis is an homage to Indian culture and traditions introduced to me by family (music), exploration (art) and self-study (yoga). These areas have been formative to my own practice and identity, and nargis is meant to free me and find new modes and new things about myself, my body and my environment. I plan to use nargis to take me where I want to be.

The nargis domains are life, beauty, health and self-knowledge. I want to include  is difficult to find and isn't all in one place. It isn't contemporary, ethereal, or cultured. At times, it's not properly researched and cited, and , it's appropriated. Next to none of it possesses the quality or sophistication I expect as a 29 year old American woman. It isn't actionable enough, then, to lend itself to the critical reader. In nargis, I want to offer a new look at the available discourse, adding to it from my own experience and making it easy to find, all in one place. It should benefit the modern person, and deliver original, applicable, healthy thinking and ideologies. I say the project is for me because editorializing is an act of self-care, one I haven't experienced without experiencing publishing. Moreover, reporting on the topics is very dear to me because much of what will be found here has been formative to my life and identity, and has saved me. I say it's for me, because when you make something and give it away, it's one of the best feelings in the world. I say it's for you because you're all I have.

My name is Sukhdeep Grewal and I am the creator of nargis.
